Ingredients:
- Rolled Oats
- Salt
- Water

Directions:
Add 2/3 cups of oats to a small pot. Add a pinch of salt. Take note of where the
oats come up to in the pot, you will want to add water so that it covers one inch
higher than where the oats are in the pot. Put the pot over high heat until
boiling, than lower to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes or until the consistency is
to your liking, stirring about every 5 minutes. Add fresh or frozen fruit, nuts,
brown sugar, or honey.
